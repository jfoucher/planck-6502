The final through hole boards for the computer, the IO board, the LCD board and the OPL2 board are in !

So far, I have tested the computer over serial, and the IO board. Both work perfectly without any issues. The PS/2 keyboard works fine when plugged into the IO board, as you can see in the video below.
