Wow so a while ago I got the [Planck 6502 bus pinout published on pinouts.ru](/news/2021/03/02/planck-6502-pinout-published-pinouts-ru.md/) and now the whole project has been linked to in the ["projects" section of 6502.org](http://6502.org/homebuilt/)!

I can't hide the fact that I am feeling rather proud about it :)
