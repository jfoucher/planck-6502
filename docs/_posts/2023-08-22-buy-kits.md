### Sold out for now, more on the way. Sorry

### Original post

I finally managed to get a hold of enough parts to make about 10 kits for the Planck 6502. I also have parts to make kits for most of the expansion boards. See below for how to buy it.

At the moment the buying process is a little manual and convoluted, because I don't have the time to setup a proper store, and Tindie doesn't handle VAT for european sellers (which I am).

So basically, if you are interested in any of the [hardware](/Hardware/), [send me an email at jfoucher@6px.eu](mailto:jfoucher@6px.eu) with what you would like to buy, and I'll send you a [Stripe](https://stripe.com) link for the payment. Of course, only the hardware that is marked as __PCB tested and working__ is available to buy.

Here are the prices :

- [Planck computer](/Hardware/mainboard/) with no ICs (only includes passive components) : $89
- [Planck computer](/Hardware/mainboard/) with all ICs (AT28C256 ROM from ebay, tested functional) : $149

- [IO board](/Hardware/io/) with no ICs : $29
- [IO board](/Hardware/io/) with all ICs : $39

- [LCD board](/Hardware/lcd/): $29

- [Prototype board](/Hardware/proto/): $5

- [OPL2 (sound) board](/Hardware/opl2/): $29

- [CompactFlash board](/Hardware/cf/) (includes surface mount soldering for CF card socket): $39

Shipping is free from $200 of purchase total. Otherwise it seems to be around $15 or so to the US, depending on the weight of the package. 

If you want a complete bundle, I have a special offer for you: $290 for one computer, one IO board, one LCD board, one OPL2 board, one CompactFlash board, and 5 prototype boards.
