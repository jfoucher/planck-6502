# Financial stats

I have decided to try and keep a running tally of costs and income for the sale of the computer and associated hardware.

So far, there have been three tindie orders, so the total income is around $200 after Tindie fees

The costs are more difficult to pin down, but I'll make a table. Everything is better with a table.

|  **What**     | **Who**                   | **Money** |
| Order 1       | Someone in UK             | +83.51 |
| Order 2       | Someone in US             | +83.51 |
| Order 2       | Someone in US             | +82.97 |
| Shipping      | La poste                  | -12 |

| Boards        | JLCPCB                    | -92.78 |
| ICs           | Mouser                    | -233.58 |
| Components    | Aliexpress                | -164.68 |
| **Total**     |                           | **-277.05** |

As of 02/11/2021

Ok, so far I have spent almost $300. Not counting what I already had in parts that I did not have to buy.

Hopefully I'll sell a few more when I receive all these parts and the new boards.
