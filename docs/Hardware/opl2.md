This is a sound card based on the [Yamaha YM3812 chip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_YM3812), also known as OPL2 chip. It was used on early PC sound cards such as the Soundblaster and Adlib and various Yamahe synthesizers.

## Prototype

Great news! [The prototype is complete and working!](/news/2021/06/26/opl2-sound-card/)

## Production PCB

The production PCB is tested and works fine. It will soon be available for order on Tindie. However still missing is the driver code for it. As of now there is only some test code that plays simple tones. You are more than welcome to [contribute some code](https://gitlab.com/planck-6502/planck-6502/-/tree/main/Software/drivers) to fix this.
