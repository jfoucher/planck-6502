The computer motherboard as well as all expansion boards not marked as "deprecated" have been redesigned using through hole components almost exclusively.

A build video is coming soon, but for now just solder the lowest components first, such as capacitors and resistors, and progress to the higher components at the end of the build.

## Finishing up and testing

Now that everything is soldered up, all that's left to do is to plug the chips in their respective sockets and give the board a test.

First check with a multimeter that you do not have a short between ground and VCC. Give a thorough visual inspection to the board to make sure that all solder joint are ok and that no bridging between pins occurs. Touch up where necessary.

Then if everything looks ok, you are ready to power up the board and test it's functionality. It's time to head on over to [the software part of this documentation](/Software)
