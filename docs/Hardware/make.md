To create your own Planck 6502 expansion board, you can use the provided expansion board template (see **Design files** above)

This Kicad project provides a base schematic and board layout for you start designing your own board.

Of course, you can also create a extension card using some prototype board and a 2x25 pins right angle header.
Actually I would strongly recommend you do have before having your PCB fabricated.

Alternatively, you could also order get a few [prototype boards](/Hardware/proto) fabricated to be able to create many boards or refine designs to your heart's content.
